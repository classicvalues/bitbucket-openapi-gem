  # unit tests for bulk_create_or_update_annotations
  # Bulk create or update annotations
  # Bulk upload of annotations. Annotations are individual findings that have been identified as part of a report, for example, a line of code that represents a vulnerability. These annotations can be attached to a specific file and even a specific line in that file, however, that is optional. Annotations are not mandatory and a report can contain up to 1000 annotations.  Add the annotations you want to upload as objects in a JSON array and make sure each annotation has the external_id field set to a unique value. If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend prefixing it with your system&#39;s name to avoid collisions, for example, mySystem-annotation001. The external id can later be used to identify the report as an alternative to the generated [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid). You can upload up to 100 annotations per POST request.  ### Sample cURL request: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl --location &#39;https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reposity-name&gt;/commit/&lt;commit-hash&gt;/reports/mysystem-001/annotations&#39; \\ --header &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\ --data-raw &#39;[   {         \&quot;external_id\&quot;: \&quot;mysystem-annotation001\&quot;,         \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Security scan report\&quot;,         \&quot;annotation_type\&quot;: \&quot;VULNERABILITY\&quot;,         \&quot;summary\&quot;: \&quot;This line represents a security threat.\&quot;,         \&quot;severity\&quot;: \&quot;HIGH\&quot;,       \&quot;path\&quot;: \&quot;my-service/src/main/java/com/myCompany/mysystem/logic/Main.java\&quot;,         \&quot;line\&quot;: 42   },   {         \&quot;external_id\&quot;: \&quot;mySystem-annotation002\&quot;,         \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Bug report\&quot;,         \&quot;annotation_type\&quot;: \&quot;BUG\&quot;,         \&quot;result\&quot;: \&quot;FAILED\&quot;,         \&quot;summary\&quot;: \&quot;This line might introduce a bug.\&quot;,         \&quot;severity\&quot;: \&quot;MEDIUM\&quot;,       \&quot;path\&quot;: \&quot;my-service/src/main/java/com/myCompany/mysystem/logic/Helper.java\&quot;,         \&quot;line\&quot;: 13   } ]&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  ### Possible field values: annotation_type: VULNERABILITY, CODE_SMELL, BUG result: PASSED, FAILED, IGNORED, SKIPPED severity: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL  Please refer to the [Code Insights documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/code-insights-994316785.html) for more information.

  # These are the repository&#39;s commits. They are paginated and returned in reverse chronological order, similar to the output of &#x60;git log&#x60;. Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.  #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/  Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest commit first). All branches and tags are included (similar to &#x60;git log --all&#x60;).  #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?exclude&#x3D;master  Returns all commits in the repo that are not on master (similar to &#x60;git log --all ^master&#x60;).  #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?include&#x3D;foo&amp;include&#x3D;bar&amp;exclude&#x3D;fu&amp;exclude&#x3D;fubar  Returns all commits that are on refs &#x60;foo&#x60; or &#x60;bar&#x60;, but not on &#x60;fu&#x60; or &#x60;fubar&#x60; (similar to &#x60;git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar&#x60;).

It is important to note that if the &#x60;path&#x60; parameter is specified, the commits returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.  #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path&#x3D;README.md&amp;include&#x3D;foo&amp;include&#x3D;bar&amp;exclude&#x3D;master  Returns all commits that are on refs &#x60;foo&#x60; or &#x60;bar&#x60;, but not on &#x60;master&#x60; that changed the file README.md.  #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path&#x3D;src/&amp;include&#x3D;foo&amp;include&#x3D;bar&amp;exclude&#x3D;master  Returns all commits that are on refs &#x60;foo&#x60; or &#x60;bar&#x60;, but not on &#x60;master&#x60; that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.
